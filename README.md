# Car-Animattion

This is a web application that demonstrates car animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The application allows you to control the movement of a car using forward and backward buttons. When the forward button is clicked, the car moves forward, and when the backward button is clicked, the car moves backward.
## Usage
